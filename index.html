<h1>CSS Framework</h1>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p></p>Building two given exercises using Bootstrap for quickly adding styled elements.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <a href="https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-framework/framework-style/index.html">Framework style</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="https://steeeeeph.github.io/css-framework/grid-away/index.html"> Grid away</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Framework style</h2>
<p>
    In this exercise the question is to make a responsive card overview according to the given wireframe. 
</p>
<p>
    The cards are displayed on mobile with all cards stacked in one column, for the tablet size the cards are stacked in two columns and full screen displays the cards stacked in four columns
    I have added a navigation bar at the top, which collapses when you go to a mobile screen size.
</p>

<h2>Grid away</h2>
<p>
    This exercise is about making a layout where you have one home page with links to other pages, styled according the given wireframes.
</p>
<p>
     This exercise definitely needs more work since I just got to the first page, which is left unfinished.
